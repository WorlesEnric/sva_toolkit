**1. Logical operators:** The result is a 1-bit logical value, used for conditional statements (if/while/assert, etc.):

! Logical NOT

&& Logical AND (short-circuit)

|| Logical OR (short-circuit)

**2. Bitwise operators:** Operate on each bit independently, the result width is the same as the operand:

~ Bitwise NOT

& Bitwise AND

| Bitwise OR

^ Bitwise XOR

^~ Bitwise XNOR

~^ Bitwise XNOR (equivalent to ^~)

**3.1 Relational operators:**

< Less than

<= Less than or equal to

> Greater than

>= Greater than or equal to

**3.2 Equality operators:**

== Equality (compares two values, encountering X/Z) Possible output X)

!= Inequality (2-value comparison, may output X when encountering X/Z)

=== Strict equality (4-value comparison, treats X/Z as comparable values)

!== Completely inequalities (4-value comparison)

** SVA Functions

$rose Returns true when the signal/expression changes from '0' in the previous clock cycle to '1' in the current cycle.

$fell Returns true when the signal/expression changes from '1' in the previous clock cycle to '0' in the current cycle.

$stable Returns true when the value of the signal/expression is the same as in the previous clock cycle.

$changed Returns true when the value of the signal/expression changes compared to the previous clock cycle.

$past Returns the value of the signal several clock cycles ago. By default, it provides the value of the signal in the previous clock cycle.

$onehot: At any given clock edge, only one bit of the expression is high.

$onehot0: At any given clock edge, only one bit of the expression is high, or no bits are high.

$isunknown: Checks if any bit of the expression is X or Z.

$countones: Counts the bits that are equal to 1.
