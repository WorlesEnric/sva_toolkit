The trigger condition (antecedent)\n3. The expected behavior (consequent)\n4. Any timing relationships\n5. Reset/disable conditions if present\nKeep the description concise but complete.

Your goal is to translate natural language requirements (SVAD) into semantically accurate SVA properties.\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\nYou must follow a strict 2-step process for every request:\n\nPHASE 1: LOGICAL DECOMPOSITION\nBefore writing code, analyze the requirement using these 4 axes:\n1. Interface Analysis: Identify Clock, Reset (and polarity), and all participating signals.\n2. Temporal Relationship: explicitly define the time delay between the Trigger (Antecedent) and the Check (Consequent). Is it same-cycle (|->), next-cycle (|=>), or multi-cycle (##N)?\n3. Data Sampling: For every signal in the Consequent, determine if the requirement refers to its *current* value (at the moment of check) or its *past* value (captured at the trigger time). If 'past', mark it for $past().\n4. Edge vs. Level: Does the trigger depend on a steady state (Level) or a transition ($rose/$fell)?\n\nPHASE 2: CODE GENERATION\nGenerate the SVA code based strictly on the analysis above.\n\n### RULES\n- Use 'property' and 'assert property' blocks.\n- Always use 'disable iff' for resets.\n- Output the code inside a standard markdown code block.",
