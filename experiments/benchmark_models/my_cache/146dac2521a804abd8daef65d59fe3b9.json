{"index": 616, "svad": "This property verifies that the counter is reset to zero one clock cycle after the active-high reset signal rst_i is asserted. The verification is triggered at every positive edge of the clock signal clk_i. When rst_i becomes 1, the property requires that on the next clock cycle, the counter must equal 0. The property is disabled when rst_i is 0, meaning no checking occurs during inactive reset conditions.
