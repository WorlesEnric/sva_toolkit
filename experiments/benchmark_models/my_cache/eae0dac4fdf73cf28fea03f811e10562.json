{"index": 887, "svad": "This property verifies that the round_nearest_trigger signal is asserted whenever specific rounding conditions occur. \n\nThe assertion triggers on every positive edge of the clk signal, unless the active-high rst signal is asserted. The trigger condition occurs when both the round_nearest signal equals 1 and bit 1 of the mantissa_term signal equals 1. When these conditions are met, the property requires that the round_nearest_trigger signal must equal 1 on the same clock cycle.\n\nThe intent is to ensure that the rounding logic correctly activates the round_nearest_trigger signal when both rounding is enabled (round_nearest is 1) and the mantissa_term[1] bit indicates a rounding condition.", "reference_sva": "property p_round_nearest_trigger;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst == 1)\n        (round_nearest == 1 && mantissa_term[1] == 1) |-> round_nearest_trigger == 1;\nendproperty\nassert_p_round_nearest_trigger: assert property (p_round_nearest_trigger) else $error(\"Assertion failed: round_nearest_trigger is not set when round_nearest is 1 and mantissa_term[1] is 1\");", "generated_sva": "property round_nearest_trigger_p;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst)\n    (round_nearest == 1 && mantissa_term[1] == 1) |-> (round_nearest_trigger == 1);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (round_nearest_trigger_p);", "relationship": "equivalent", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_round_nearest_trigger\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `mantissa_term`, `round_nearest`, `round_nearest_trigger`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `clk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `rst` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(round_nearest == 1 && mantissa_term[1] == 1)`\n    * Response condition: `round_nearest_trigger == 1`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(round_nearest == 1 && mantissa_term[1] == 1)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `round_nearest_trigger == 1`\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (rst == 1)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `rst` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge clk) (round_nearest == 1 && mantissa_term[1] == 1) |-> round_nearest_trigger == 1`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_round_nearest_trigger;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst == 1)\n        (round_nearest == 1 && mantissa_term[1] == 1) |-> round_nearest_trigger == 1;\nendproperty\nassert_p_round_nearest_trigger: assert property (p_round_nearest_trigger) else $error(\"Assertion failed: round_nearest_trigger is not set when round_nearest is 1 and mantissa_term[1] is 1\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_round_nearest_trigger` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `clk`.", "error_message": null, "generation_time": 2.478285312652588, "verification_time": 0.005944252014160156, "from_cache": false}
