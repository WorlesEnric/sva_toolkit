{"index": 914, "svad": "This property verifies that when the system is not in reset and the enable signal is active, the exponent_a signal will be assigned the previous value of opa[62:52] exactly one clock cycle later.\n\nThe property triggers on every positive edge of the clk signal, but is disabled when the rst signal is asserted. The verification condition occurs when both rst is deasserted and enable is asserted simultaneously.
