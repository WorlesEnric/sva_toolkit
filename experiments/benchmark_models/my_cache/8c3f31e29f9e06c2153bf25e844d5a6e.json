{"index": 160, "svad": "This property verifies that when the load signal is asserted, the counter signal equals the previous value of the count signal on the next clock cycle. Specifically, whenever load becomes 1, the assertion checks that one clock cycle later, counter matches the value that count had at the time load was asserted. The verification occurs on every positive edge of the clk, but is disabled when the reset signal is active (equal to 1).
