{"index": 1, "svad": "This property verifies that when a write buffer address register assignment occurs, it correctly captures the previous address value.\n\nThe property triggers on every positive edge of the i_clk clock signal when all of the following conditions are simultaneously true: wb_wait equals 1, wbuf_busy_r equals 0, and either core_write_request equals 1 or cache_write_request equals 1.\n\nWhen this trigger condition occurs, the property expects that on the very next clock cycle (after exactly one clock cycle delay), the signal wbuf_addr_r must equal the previous value of the i_address signal from the triggering clock cycle.\n\nThe timing relationship ensures that the address capture happens exactly one clock cycle after the qualifying conditions are met.
