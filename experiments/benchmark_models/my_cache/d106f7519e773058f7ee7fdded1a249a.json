{"index": 322, "svad": "This property verifies that when the system is in a specific state, the S array and Step signal correctly capture values from the previous clock cycle.\n\nThe property triggers on every positive edge of the clk signal when the system is not in reset (reset equals 0), the Step signal equals Step1, and the Sm_ready signal is 1. When this condition occurs, the property requires that on the next clock cycle (after one clock cycle delay), all 16 elements of the S array (S[1] through S[16]) must equal their corresponding Sm signals (Sm1 through Sm16) from the previous clock cycle. Additionally, the Step signal must equal the Step2 value from the previous clock cycle.\n\nThe property is disabled and does not check during active reset conditions (when reset equals 1). The verification uses the $past function to reference signal values from the previous clock cycle, ensuring that the S array and Step signal properly reflect the historical state of the Sm signals and Step2 value.", "reference_sva": "property p_S_and_Step_assignment;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset == 1)\n        (reset == 0 && Step == Step1 && Sm_ready == 1) |-> \n        ##1 S[1] == $past(Sm1) && \n            S[2] == $past(Sm2) && \n            S[3] == $past(Sm3) && \n            S[4] == $past(Sm4) && \n            S[5] == $past(Sm5) && \n            S[6] == $past(Sm6) && \n            S[7] == $past(Sm7) && \n            S[8] == $past(Sm8) && \n            S[9] == $past(Sm9) && \n            S[10] == $past(Sm10) && \n            S[11] == $past(Sm11) && \n            S[12] == $past(Sm12) && \n            S[13] == $past(Sm13) && \n            S[14] == $past(Sm14) && \n            S[15] == $past(Sm15) && \n            S[16] == $past(Sm16) && \n            Step == $past(Step2);\nendproperty\nassert_p_S_and_Step_assignment: assert property (p_S_and_Step_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: S and Step signals do not reflect the correct state after Step1 and Sm_ready\");", "generated_sva": "", "relationship": "error", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_S_and_Step_assignment\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `S`, `Sm1`, `Sm10`, `Sm11`, `Sm12`, `Sm13`, `Sm14`, `Sm15`, `Sm16`, `Sm2`, `Sm3`, `Sm4`, `Sm5`, `Sm6`, `Sm7`, `Sm8`, `Sm9`, `Sm_ready`, `Step`, `Step1`, `Step2`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `clk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `reset` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain -
