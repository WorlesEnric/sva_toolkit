{"index": 661, "svad": "This property verifies that the pin_control_oe signal maintains the correct value when SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_3 is asserted and the system is not in reset.\n\nThe property triggers at every positive edge of the clk signal, provided the nreset signal is active (high). When both SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_3 is high and nreset is high, the property requires that pin_control_oe must equal the logical AND of SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_3 and nreset.\n\nSince SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_3 and nreset are both high in the trigger condition, their logical AND evaluates to 1, so pin_control_oe must be 1.
