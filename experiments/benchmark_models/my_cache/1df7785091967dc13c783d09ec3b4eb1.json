{"index": 298, "svad": "This property verifies that the address assignment logic correctly transfers the value from the r_depp register to the addr signal after a specific write operation.\n\nThe assertion triggers on every positive edge of the i_clk clock signal when both the w_write signal is 1 and the astb signal is 1 simultaneously. When this condition occurs, the property requires that exactly one clock cycle later, the addr signal must equal the previous value of the r_depp signal from the triggering clock edge.\n\nThe verification ensures that the address assignment occurs with a one-cycle delay following a valid write operation indicated by the concurrent assertion of w_write and astb.", "reference_sva": "property p_addr_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge i_clk)\n        (w_write == 1 && astb == 1) |-> ##1 addr == $past(r_depp);\nendproperty\nassert_p_addr_assignment_logic: assert property (p_addr_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: addr signal does not match the expected value from r_depp after one clock cycle\");", "generated_sva": "", "relationship": "error", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_addr_assignment_logic\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `addr`, `astb`, `r_depp`, `w_write`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `i_clk` (posedge)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(w_write == 1 && astb == 1)`\n    * Response condition: `##1 addr == $past(r_depp)`\n\n* **Edge/Change Detection & Built-in Functions:**\n    * `$past(r_depp)`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n\n* **Past Values:**\n    * Reference to previous value of `r_depp`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(w_write == 1 && astb == 1)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `##1 addr == $past(r_depp)`\n    * Timing: 1 cycle(s)\n\n* **Temporal Operators Used:**\n    * `##`: Cycle delay operator\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * None specified - property always active\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge i_clk) (w_write == 1 && astb == 1) |-> ##1 addr == $past(r_depp)`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_addr_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge i_clk)\n        (w_write == 1 && astb == 1) |-> ##1 addr == $past(r_depp);\nendproperty\nassert_p_addr_assignment_logic: assert property (p_addr_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: addr signal does not match the expected value from r_depp after one clock cycle\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_addr_assignment_logic` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `i_clk` using built-in functions: $past.", "error_message": "Generation error: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable", "generation_time": 11.194143533706665, "verification_time": 5.4836273193359375e-06, "from_cache": false}
