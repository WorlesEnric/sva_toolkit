{"index": 445, "svad": "This property verifies that when both the CS and WR signals are high (1) at a positive clock edge of clk, the mode[6] signal must be set to 1 exactly one clock cycle later.\n\nThe trigger condition occurs at any positive edge of clk where CS equals 1 and WR equals 1 simultaneously. Following this condition, the expected behavior is that on the very next positive clock edge of clk, the value of mode[6] must be 1.\n\nThe property implicitly checks the timing relationship where the assignment to mode[6] is delayed by exactly one clock cycle from the occurrence of CS and WR both being high.
