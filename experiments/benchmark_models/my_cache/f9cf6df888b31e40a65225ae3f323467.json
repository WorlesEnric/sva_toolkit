{"index": 82, "svad": "This property verifies that the rdy1 signal becomes 0 exactly one clock cycle after the reset signal is asserted.\n\nThe property triggers at every positive edge of the ckdr clock. When the reset signal transitions to 1, the property requires that on the very next clock cycle (##1), the rdy1 signal must be 0.\n\nThe verification is disabled when reset is 0, meaning the property only checks behavior when reset is active (high).
