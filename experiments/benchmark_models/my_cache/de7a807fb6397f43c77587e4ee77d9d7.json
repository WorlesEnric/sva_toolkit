{"index": 66, "svad": "This property verifies that when the Wishbone state is WB_IDLE and the start_access signal is asserted, the o_wb_sel signal in the next clock cycle matches the value of the byte_enable signal from the previous clock cycle.\n\nThe trigger condition occurs at the positive edge of the i_clk clock when both the wishbone_st signal is in the WB_IDLE state and the start_access signal is high. Upon this condition, the property checks that exactly one clock cycle later, the o_wb_sel signal equals the value that the byte_enable signal had in the cycle immediately preceding the trigger.\n\nThe expected behavior ensures that the o_wb_sel signal is correctly assigned from the byte_enable signal with a one-cycle delay under the specified conditions.
