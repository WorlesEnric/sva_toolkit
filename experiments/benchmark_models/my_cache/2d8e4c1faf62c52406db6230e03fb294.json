{"index": 208, "svad": "This property verifies that the write pointer increments correctly under specific conditions. The assertion triggers on every positive edge of the wr_clk clock signal when three conditions are simultaneously true: i_push equals 1, o_full equals 0, and wr_pointer is less than 1. When these trigger conditions are met, the property requires that exactly one clock cycle later, the value of wr_pointer must equal its previous value (captured using the $past function) incremented by 1. The property effectively checks that a valid push operation into a non-full buffer with the write pointer in its initial state results in the expected pointer advancement.", "reference_sva": "property p_wr_pointer_increment;\n    @(posedge wr_clk)\n        (i_push == 1 && o_full == 0 && wr_pointer < 1) |-> ##1 wr_pointer == $past(wr_pointer) + 1'd1;\nendproperty\nassert_p_wr_pointer_increment: assert property (p_wr_pointer_increment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: wr_pointer did not increment correctly when i_push is 1, o_full is 0, and wr_pointer is less than 1\");", "generated_sva": "property wr_pointer_increment;\n  @(posedge wr_clk) disable iff (rst)\n  (i_push && !o_full && (wr_pointer < 1)) |=> (wr_pointer == ($past(wr_pointer) + 1));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (wr_pointer_increment);", "relationship": "equivalent", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_wr_pointer_increment\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `d1`, `i_push`, `o_full`, `wr_pointer`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `wr_clk` (posedge)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(i_push == 1 && o_full == 0 && wr_pointer < 1)`\n    * Response condition: `##1 wr_pointer == $past(wr_pointer) + 1'd1`\n\n* **Edge/Change Detection & Built-in Functions:**\n    * `$past(wr_pointer)`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n\n* **Past Values:**\n    * Reference to previous value of `wr_pointer`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(i_push == 1 && o_full == 0 && wr_pointer < 1)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `##1 wr_pointer == $past(wr_pointer) + 1'd1`\n    * Timing: 1 cycle(s)\n\n* **Temporal Operators Used:**\n    * `##`: Cycle delay operator\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * None specified - property always active\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge wr_clk) (i_push == 1 && o_full == 0 && wr_pointer < 1) |-> ##1 wr_pointer == $past(wr_pointer) + 1'd1`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_wr_pointer_increment;\n    @(posedge wr_clk)\n        (i_push == 1 && o_full == 0 && wr_pointer < 1) |-> ##1 wr_pointer == $past(wr_pointer) + 1'd1;\nendproperty\nassert_p_wr_pointer_increment: assert property (p_wr_pointer_increment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: wr_pointer did not increment correctly when i_push is 1, o_full is 0, and wr_pointer is less than 1\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_wr_pointer_increment` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `wr_clk` using built-in functions: $past.", "error_message": null, "generation_time": 2.927412748336792, "verification_time": 0.02052617073059082, "from_cache": false}
