{"index": 631, "svad": "This property verifies the correct assignment logic for signal CrcNext[0] under specific conditions. The assertion triggers on every positive edge of the Clk signal, unless the Reset signal is active high (1).\n\nWhen Enable equals 1, Data[0] equals 1, and Crc[28] equals 0 simultaneously, the property requires that CrcNext[0] must equal the logical AND of Enable with the XOR of Data[0] and Crc[28]. Since Data[0] is 1 and Crc[28] is 0 in this condition, the XOR result is 1, and the AND with Enable (which is 1) produces a value of 1. Therefore, CrcNext[0] must be 1 in this scenario.\n\nThe property ensures that CrcNext[0] correctly reflects this specific combinatorial logic calculation whenever the enabling conditions are met on a clock edge.", "reference_sva": "property p_CrcNext_0_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge Clk) disable iff (Reset == 1)\n        (Enable == 1 && Data[0] == 1 && Crc[28] == 0) |-> (CrcNext[0] == (Enable & (Data[0] ^ Crc[28])));\nendproperty\nassert_p_CrcNext_0_assignment_logic: assert property (p_CrcNext_0_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: CrcNext[0] does not reflect the correct logic when Enable is 1, Data[0] is 1, and Crc[28] is 0\");", "generated_sva": "property CrcNext0_Assignment;\n  @(posedge Clk) disable iff (Reset)\n  (Enable && (Data[0] == 1'b1) && (Crc[28] == 1'b0)) |-> (CrcNext[0] == (Enable & (Data[0] ^ Crc[28])));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (CrcNext0_Assignment);", "relationship": "equivalent", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_CrcNext_0_assignment_logic\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `Crc`, `CrcNext`, `Data`, `Enable`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `Clk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `Reset` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(Enable == 1 && Data[0] == 1 && Crc[28] == 0)`\n    * Response condition: `(CrcNext[0] == (Enable & (Data[0] ^ Crc[28])))`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(Enable == 1 && Data[0] == 1 && Crc[28] == 0)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `(CrcNext[0] == (Enable & (Data[0] ^ Crc[28])))`\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (Reset == 1)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `Reset` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge Clk) (Enable == 1 && Data[0] == 1 && Crc[28] == 0) |-> (CrcNext[0] == (Enable & (Data[0] ^ Crc[28])))`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_CrcNext_0_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge Clk) disable iff (Reset == 1)\n        (Enable == 1 && Data[0] == 1 && Crc[28] == 0) |-> (CrcNext[0] == (Enable & (Data[0] ^ Crc[28])));\nendproperty\nassert_p_CrcNext_0_assignment_logic: assert property (p_CrcNext_0_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: CrcNext[0] does not reflect the correct logic when Enable is 1, Data[0] is 1, and Crc[28] is 0\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_CrcNext_0_assignment_logic` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `Clk`.", "error_message": null, "generation_time": 2.938011407852173, "verification_time": 0.026201248168945312, "from_cache": false}
