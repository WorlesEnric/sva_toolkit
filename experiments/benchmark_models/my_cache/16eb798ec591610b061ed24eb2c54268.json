{"index": 520, "svad": "This property verifies the correct assignment logic for the QSync signal when the system is not in reset.\n\nThe property triggers on every positive edge of the clock signal clk and is disabled when the reset signal rst is active-high (1).\n\nWhen rst is low (0), the property requires that on the next clock cycle (##1), the QSync signal must equal a specific concatenated value. This value consists of three bits:\n- The most significant bit is the logical AND of the inverted value of the least significant bit of QSync from the previous cycle (~$past(QSync[0])) with the second bit of QSync from the previous cycle ($past(QSync[1]))\n- The middle bit is the least significant bit of QSync from the previous cycle ($past(QSync[0]))\n- The least significant bit is the value of the din signal from the previous cycle ($past(din))\n\nIn essence, the property ensures that QSync correctly shifts in the previous din value while performing a specific logical operation on its previous state bits when the system is out of reset.", "reference_sva": "property p_QSync_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst == 1)\n        rst == 0 |-> ##1 QSync == {~$past(QSync[0]) & $past(QSync[1]), $past(QSync[0]), $past(din)};\nendproperty\nassert_p_QSync_assignment_logic: assert property (p_QSync_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: QSync assignment logic is incorrect\");", "generated_sva": "property qsync_assignment_check;\n  @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst)\n  (!rst) |=> (QSync == {($past(~QSync[0]) & $past(QSync[1])), $past(QSync[0]), $past(din)});\nendproperty\n\nassert property (qsync_assignment_check);", "relationship": "equivalent", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_QSync_assignment_logic\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `QSync`, `din`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `clk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `rst` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `rst == 0`\n    * Response condition: `##1 QSync == {~$past(QSync[0]) & $past(QSync[1]), $past(QSync[0]), $past(din)}`\n\n* **Edge/Change Detection & Built-in Functions:**\n    * `$past(QSync[0])`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n    * `$past(QSync[1])`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n    * `$past(QSync[0])`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n    * `$past(din)`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n\n* **Past Values:**\n    * Reference to previous value of `QSync[0]`\n    * Reference to previous value of `QSync[1]`\n    * Reference to previous value of `QSync[0]`\n    * Reference to previous value of `din`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `rst == 0`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `##1 QSync == {~$past(QSync[0]) & $past(QSync[1]), $past(QSync[0]), $past(din)}`\n    * Timing: 1 cycle(s)\n\n* **Temporal Operators Used:**\n    * `##`: Cycle delay operator\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (rst == 1)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `rst` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge clk) rst == 0 |-> ##1 QSync == {~$past(QSync[0]) & $past(QSync[1]), $past(QSync[0]), $past(din)}`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_QSync_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst == 1)\n        rst == 0 |-> ##1 QSync == {~$past(QSync[0]) & $past(QSync[1]), $past(QSync[0]), $past(din)};\nendproperty\nassert_p_QSync_assignment_logic: assert property (p_QSync_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: QSync assignment logic is incorrect\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_QSync_assignment_logic` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `clk` using built-in functions: $past.", "error_message": null, "generation_time": 29.49749445915222, "verification_time": 0.00728154182434082, "from_cache": false}
