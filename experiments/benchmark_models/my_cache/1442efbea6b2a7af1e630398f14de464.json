{"index": 257, "svad": "This property verifies that the dstb signal correctly reflects the logical AND of the inverted r_dstb_n and l_dstb_n signals when specific conditions occur. \n\nThe assertion triggers on every positive edge of the i_clk clock signal when r_dstb_n is 0 and l_dstb_n is 1 simultaneously. When this condition occurs, the property requires that dstb must equal the result of (~r_dstb_n & l_dstb_n), which evaluates to (1 & 1) = 1. \n\nIn simpler terms, whenever r_dstb_n is low and l_dstb_n is high at a clock edge, dstb must be driven high.
