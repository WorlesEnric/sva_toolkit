{"index": 356, "svad": "This property verifies the correct assignment of signal D and transition to Step4 under specific conditions. \n\nThe property triggers when all of the following conditions are true at a positive clock edge: reset is inactive (0), the current Step is Step3, signal N equals 0, and the element S[K + e_cnt] is non-zero.\n\nWhen these trigger conditions are met, the property requires that in the very next clock cycle:\n- Signal D must equal the previous value of S[K + e_cnt] (the value from the cycle when the trigger occurred)\n- The Step must equal the previous value of Step4 (the value from the cycle when the trigger occurred)\n\nThe property is disabled and not checked when reset is active (1). The verification ensures that when the specific Step3 conditions are satisfied, the design correctly assigns D from the S array and transitions to Step4 in the subsequent cycle.", "reference_sva": "property p_D_assignment_logic_Step3;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset == 1)\n        (reset == 0 && Step == Step3 && N == 0 && S[K + e_cnt] != 0) |-> ##1 (D == $past(S[K + e_cnt]) && Step == $past(Step4));\nendproperty\nassert_p_D_assignment_logic_Step3: assert property (p_D_assignment_logic_Step3) else $error(\"Assertion failed: D does not match the expected value or Step is not Step4 in the next cycle after the conditions are met.\");", "generated_sva": "", "relationship": "error", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_D_assignment_logic_Step3\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `D`, `K`, `N`, `S`, `Step`, `Step3`, `Step4`, `e_cnt`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `clk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `reset` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(reset == 0 && Step == Step3 && N == 0 && S[K + e_cnt] != 0)`\n    * Response condition: `##1 (D == $past(S[K + e_cnt]) && Step == $past(Step4))`\n\n* **Edge/Change Detection & Built-in Functions:**\n    * `$past(S[K + e_cnt])`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n    * `$past(Step4)`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n\n* **Past Values:**\n    * Reference to previous value of `S[K + e_cnt]`\n    * Reference to previous value of `Step4`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(reset == 0 && Step == Step3 && N == 0 && S[K + e_cnt] != 0)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `##1 (D == $past(S[K + e_cnt]) && Step == $past(Step4))`\n    * Timing: 1 cycle(s)\n\n* **Temporal Operators Used:**\n    * `##`: Cycle delay operator\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (reset == 1)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `reset` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge clk) (reset == 0 && Step == Step3 && N == 0 && S[K + e_cnt] != 0) |-> ##1 (D == $past(S[K + e_cnt]) && Step == $past(Step4))`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_D_assignment_logic_Step3;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset == 1)\n        (reset == 0 && Step == Step3 && N == 0 && S[K + e_cnt] != 0) |-> ##1 (D == $past(S[K + e_cnt]) && Step == $past(Step4));\nendproperty\nassert_p_D_assignment_logic_Step3: assert property (p_D_assignment_logic_Step3) else $error(\"Assertion failed: D does not match the expected value or Step is not Step4 in the next cycle after the conditions are met.\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_D_assignment_logic_Step3` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `clk` using built-in functions: $past.", "error_message": "Verification error: SVA Syntax Error: Syntax error in SVA: file /tmp/sva_check_oyymufwr/sva_checker.sv line 34: syntax error, unexpected ')' before ')'", "generation_time": 46.42813539505005, "verification_time": 0.014152050018310547, "from_cache": false}
