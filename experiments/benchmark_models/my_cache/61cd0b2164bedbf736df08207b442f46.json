{"index": 45, "svad": "This property verifies that the signal bra_ex is set to 2'h0 exactly one clock cycle after the reset signal grst becomes active-high. Specifically, whenever grst transitions to 1 on a rising edge of the clock gclk, the property expects that on the next clock cycle (##1), the value of bra_ex must be 2'h0. The assertion is disabled when grst is 0, meaning it only checks the behavior when grst is asserted.
