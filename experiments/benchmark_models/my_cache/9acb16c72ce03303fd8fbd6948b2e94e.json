{"index": 845, "svad": "This property verifies that the DeferLatched signal becomes 0 exactly one clock cycle after the Reset signal is asserted. The check is triggered on every positive edge of the MTxClk clock when Reset transitions to 1. Once this occurs, the property requires that on the next clock cycle (##1), DeferLatched must be 0.
