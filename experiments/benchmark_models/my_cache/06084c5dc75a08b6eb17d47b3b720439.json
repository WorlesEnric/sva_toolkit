{"index": 302, "svad": "This property verifies that the awvalid signal becomes inactive (equals 0) exactly one clock cycle after the reset signal M_AXI_ARESETN is deasserted (equals 0). \n\nThe verification is triggered when the reset signal M_AXI_ARESETN transitions to 0 (deasserted) on the rising edge of the clock M_AXI_ACLK. When this occurs, the property requires that on the very next clock cycle (##1), the awvalid signal must be 0.\n\nThe assertion is disabled when the reset signal M_AXI_ARESETN is asserted (equals 1), meaning no checking occurs during active reset conditions.
