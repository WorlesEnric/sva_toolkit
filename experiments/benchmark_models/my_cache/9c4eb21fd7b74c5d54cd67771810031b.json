{"index": 96, "svad": "This property verifies that the pop signal correctly reflects the condition when data is being transferred and the write buffer has entries. \n\nThe assertion triggers on every positive edge of the i_clk clock signal. The trigger condition occurs when o_valid is high, i_accepted is high, and wbuf_used_r is not zero. When this condition is met, the property expects the pop signal to be high, indicating that an entry should be removed from the buffer. \n\nEssentially, the property checks that pop is asserted exactly when o_valid, i_accepted, and a non-zero wbuf_used_r are all simultaneously true.
