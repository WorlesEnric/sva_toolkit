{"index": 126, "svad": "This property verifies that when the system is not in reset and the data enable signal is active with a specific register selected, the special function register multiplexer output matches the expected value on the next clock cycle.\n\nSpecifically, the property triggers when all of the following conditions are true at the positive edge of the gclk clock: the reset signal grst is low (0), the data enable signal dena is high (1), and the register select signal sfr_sel has the value 3'o5. When these conditions occur, the property requires that on the next clock cycle (##1), the output signal sfr_mx must equal a concatenation of 30 zero bits and the previous value of the rESR_C signal (captured using the $past function).\n\nThe property is disabled and does not check during active reset conditions, specifically when the grst signal is high (1).
