{"index": 113, "svad": "This property verifies that the grant signal resets to all zeros one clock cycle after the reset signal becomes active.\n\nSpecifically, when the active-high reset signal rst_i transitions to 1, then exactly one clock cycle later (at the next positive edge of clock signal clk_i), the grant signal must equal a value consisting of RCNT number of 1'b0 bits. This means the grant signal must be a vector of RCNT bits wide, with all bits set to zero.\n\nThe verification is disabled when rst_i is 0, meaning the property only checks behavior when reset is active.
