{"index": 948, "svad": "This property verifies that the output signal 'o' correctly reflects the logical AND of the 'overflow' signal and the inverted 'tcr_write' signal when specific conditions occur.\n\nThe property triggers on every positive edge of the 'clk' signal when 'overflow' is high (1) and 'tcr_write' is low (0).
