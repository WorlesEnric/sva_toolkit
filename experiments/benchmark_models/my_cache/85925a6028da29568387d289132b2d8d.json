{"index": 444, "svad": "This property verifies that the wb_racc signal correctly reflects the logical AND of module_sel and the inverse of wb_we_i during read cycles when the module is selected.\n\nThe property triggers on every positive edge of the wb_clk_i clock signal, provided the active-high reset signal wb_rst_i is not asserted. The trigger condition occurs when both module_sel is 1 and wb_we_i is 0, indicating a read access to the selected module.\n\nWhen this condition is met, the property expects wb_racc to be equal to the result of the logical operation (module_sel AND NOT wb_we_i), which evaluates to 1 in this case.\n\nThe property is disabled and not checked when the wb_rst_i reset signal is active (equal to 1).", "reference_sva": "property p_wb_racc_assignment;\n    @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n    disable iff (wb_rst_i == 1)\n    (module_sel == 1 && wb_we_i == 0) |-> (wb_racc == (module_sel & ~wb_we_i));\nendproperty\nassert_p_wb_racc_assignment: assert property (p_wb_racc_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: wb_racc signal does not reflect the correct state when module_sel is 1 and wb_we_i is 0\");", "generated_sva": "assert property (\n    @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n    (module_sel && !wb_we_i) |-> (wb_racc == 1'b1)\n);", "relationship": "equivalent", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_wb_racc_assignment\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `module_sel`, `wb_racc`, `wb_we_i`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `wb_clk_i` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `wb_rst_i` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(module_sel == 1 && wb_we_i == 0)`\n    * Response condition: `(wb_racc == (module_sel & ~wb_we_i))`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(module_sel == 1 && wb_we_i == 0)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `(wb_racc == (module_sel & ~wb_we_i))`\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (wb_rst_i == 1)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `wb_rst_i` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge wb_clk_i) (module_sel == 1 && wb_we_i == 0) |-> (wb_racc == (module_sel & ~wb_we_i))`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_wb_racc_assignment;\n    @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n    disable iff (wb_rst_i == 1)\n    (module_sel == 1 && wb_we_i == 0) |-> (wb_racc == (module_sel & ~wb_we_i));\nendproperty\nassert_p_wb_racc_assignment: assert property (p_wb_racc_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: wb_racc signal does not reflect the correct state when module_sel is 1 and wb_we_i is 0\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_wb_racc_assignment` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `wb_clk_i`.", "error_message": null, "generation_time": 20.256821632385254, "verification_time": 0.02730274200439453, "from_cache": false}
