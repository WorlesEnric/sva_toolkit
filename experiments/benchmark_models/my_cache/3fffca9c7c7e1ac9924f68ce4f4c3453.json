{"index": 419, "svad": "This property verifies that the output data signal dout correctly reflects the value read from memory dfq_mem after a read operation. The property triggers on every positive edge of the clock signal clk when both the reset signal reset_l is active-high and the read enable signal rd_en is asserted. When this condition occurs, the property requires that exactly one clock cycle later, the output signal dout must equal the value that was stored in the memory location dfq_mem indexed by the read address rd_adr[4:0] at the previous clock cycle.
