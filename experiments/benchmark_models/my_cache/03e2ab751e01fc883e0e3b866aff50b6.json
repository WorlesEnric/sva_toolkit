{"index": 395, "svad": "This property verifies that the output signal O correctly implements the assignment logic when specific input conditions are met. The check occurs on every positive edge of the clock signal clk, unless the active-high reset signal rst is asserted.\n\nThe property triggers when all of the following conditions are simultaneously true: signal B equals 1, signal D equals 1, signal A equals 0, and signal C equals 0.
