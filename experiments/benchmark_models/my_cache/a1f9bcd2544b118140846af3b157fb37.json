{"index": 2, "svad": "This property verifies that the read_ack signal correctly reflects the read acknowledgment state during Wishbone bus read operations. \n\nThe verification triggers on every positive edge of the i_clk clock signal when both o_wb_we is 0 (indicating a read operation) and i_wb_ack is 1 (indicating bus acknowledgment). When these conditions occur, the property requires that read_ack must equal the logical AND of the inverted o_wb_we signal and the i_wb_ack signal, which should evaluate to 1 in this scenario.\n\nEssentially, this ensures that read_ack is asserted exactly when there is an acknowledged read transaction on the bus.", "reference_sva": "property p_read_ack_assignment;\n    @(posedge i_clk)\n        (o_wb_we == 0 && i_wb_ack == 1) |-> (read_ack == (~o_wb_we & i_wb_ack));\nendproperty\nassert_p_read_ack_assignment: assert property (p_read_ack_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: read_ack signal does not reflect the correct state when o_wb_we is 0 and i_wb_ack is 1\");", "generated_sva": "property read_ack_property;\n  @(posedge i_clk) disable iff (rst)\n  (o_wb_we == 0 && i_wb_ack == 1) |-> (read_ack == (o_wb_we == 0 && i_wb_ack == 1));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (read_ack_property);", "relationship": "equivalent", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_read_ack_assignment\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `i_wb_ack`, `o_wb_we`, `read_ack`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `i_clk` (posedge)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(o_wb_we == 0 && i_wb_ack == 1)`\n    * Response condition: `(read_ack == (~o_wb_we & i_wb_ack))`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(o_wb_we == 0 && i_wb_ack == 1)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `(read_ack == (~o_wb_we & i_wb_ack))`\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * None specified - property always active\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge i_clk) (o_wb_we == 0 && i_wb_ack == 1) |-> (read_ack == (~o_wb_we & i_wb_ack))`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_read_ack_assignment;\n    @(posedge i_clk)\n        (o_wb_we == 0 && i_wb_ack == 1) |-> (read_ack == (~o_wb_we & i_wb_ack));\nendproperty\nassert_p_read_ack_assignment: assert property (p_read_ack_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: read_ack signal does not reflect the correct state when o_wb_we is 0 and i_wb_ack is 1\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_read_ack_assignment` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `i_clk`.", "error_message": null, "generation_time": 2.701536178588867, "verification_time": 0.009612083435058594, "from_cache": false}
