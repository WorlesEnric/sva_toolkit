{"index": 680, "svad": "This property verifies that signal SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_4 is correctly assigned to logic high when all three control signals in_intr, M1, and T1 are simultaneously high. The check is triggered at every positive edge of clock signal clk, but only when the active-high reset signal nreset is asserted (nreset equals 1). Specifically, whenever in_intr, M1, and T1 are all equal to 1 at a clock edge, the property requires that SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_4 must be 1 at that same clock edge.
