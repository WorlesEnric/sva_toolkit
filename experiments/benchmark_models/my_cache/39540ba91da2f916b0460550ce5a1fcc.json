{"index": 596, "svad": "This property verifies that when the reset signal rst_i becomes active (high), the current state cur_state equals the previous value of the STOPPED state on the next clock cycle.\n\nThe assertion triggers at every positive edge of the clock signal clk_i. When rst_i is high, the property requires that one clock cycle later, cur_state must match the value that STOPPED had in the previous clock cycle.\n\nThe property is disabled when rst_i is low (0), meaning the check is only active during reset conditions.
