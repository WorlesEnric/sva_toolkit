{"index": 383, "svad": "This property verifies that the signal `xwb_fb` always matches the XNOR (logical equivalence) of `xwb_stb_o` and `xwb_ack_i` under a specific condition. The check occurs on every rising edge of the clock `gclk` and is disabled when the reset signal `grst` is high.\n\nThe trigger condition is that `xwb_stb_o` is 1 and `xwb_ack_i` is 0. When this condition holds, the property expects that `xwb_fb` must be equal to the result of the XNOR operation between `xwb_stb_o` and `xwb_ack_i`.
