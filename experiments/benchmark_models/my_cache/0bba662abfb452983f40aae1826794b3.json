{"index": 765, "svad": "This property verifies that a memory write operation correctly updates the RAM content. Specifically, when the write signal Wr is asserted high, the RAM location addressed by A should contain the data value DI on the next clock cycle.\n\nThe assertion triggers on every positive edge of the clock signal Clk, except when the active-high reset signal Rst is asserted. When Wr equals 1, the property requires that one clock cycle later, the RAM array at the address value from the previous cycle (captured using $past(A)) must equal the data input value from the previous cycle (captured using $past(DI)).
