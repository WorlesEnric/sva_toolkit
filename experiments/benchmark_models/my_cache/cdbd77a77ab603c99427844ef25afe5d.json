{"index": 371, "svad": "This property verifies that the debug_ena signal is assigned to 0 one clock cycle after the async_rst_b reset signal is deasserted. The assertion triggers on every positive edge of the bus_clk clock signal, but is disabled when async_rst_b is asserted (active high). Specifically, whenever async_rst_b transitions to 0 (deasserted), the debug_ena signal must be 0 at the next clock cycle.
