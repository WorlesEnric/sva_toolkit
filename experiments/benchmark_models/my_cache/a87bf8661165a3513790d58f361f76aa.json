{"index": 412, "svad": "This property verifies that when the active-high reset signal res_n is asserted (equal to 1) and the signal bit_slip_cnt is less than DWIDTH minus 1, then on the next clock cycle of clk, the signal data_out_temp must equal the previous clock cycle's value of buffer2.\n\nThe trigger condition occurs at every positive edge of clk when res_n is 1 and bit_slip_cnt is less than DWIDTH-1. When this condition is met, the expected behavior is that one clock cycle later, data_out_temp matches the value that buffer2 had at the time of the trigger.\n\nThe property is disabled when res_n is 0, which acts as an asynchronous reset.
