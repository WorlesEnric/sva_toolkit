Specifically, on every positive edge of the clk_core clock, if the active-high reset rst_x is deasserted (equal to 0), then in the very next clock cycle, the rs_valid signal must be set to a value of all zeros, where the width of rs_valid is determined by the parameter DEPTH and each bit is set to 1'b0.
