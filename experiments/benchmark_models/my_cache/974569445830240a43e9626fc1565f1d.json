{"index": 409, "svad": "This property verifies that when the system is in Step3 with N equal to 0 and the specific element of array S at index K plus e_cnt is non-zero, the value of signal D in the next clock cycle must equal the previous value of that same S array element.\n\nThe property triggers when all of the following conditions are simultaneously true at a positive clock edge of clk: reset is 0, Step equals Step3, N equals 0, and S[K + e_cnt] is not equal to 0. When this trigger condition occurs, the property requires that exactly one clock cycle later, signal D must match the value that S[K + e_cnt] had at the time of the trigger.\n\nThe property is disabled and not checked when reset is asserted high.
