{"index": 742, "svad": "This property verifies that the HF signal correctly reflects the logical OR operation between two specific elements of the Cnt array when a particular condition occurs.\n\nThe property triggers on every positive edge of the Clk signal, unless the active-high Rst signal is asserted.
