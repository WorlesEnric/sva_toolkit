{"index": 403, "svad": "This property verifies that the DMG signal is correctly assigned when specific conditions occur. The assertion triggers on every positive edge of the clk signal, unless the rst signal is high, which disables the check.\n\nWhen the O signal is 1, the f signal is 0, and the hp signal is not equal to the h signal, the DMG signal must equal the logical AND of the O signal and the logical NOT of the expression (f AND (hp equals h)).
