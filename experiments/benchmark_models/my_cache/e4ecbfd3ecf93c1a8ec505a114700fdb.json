{"index": 736, "svad": "This property verifies that when the signals r_dividend and r_divisor hold the specific values 32'h00000010 and 32'h00000008 respectively, the signal diff correctly reflects the bitwise AND of the difference between r_dividend and r_divisor with the constant 32'h7FFFFFFF.\n\nThe trigger condition occurs at every positive edge of the clock signal i_clk, but only when the reset signal i_rst is not active. Specifically, the property checks that whenever r_dividend equals 32'h00000010 and r_divisor equals 32'h00000008, then in the same clock cycle, the value of diff must equal the result of (r_dividend - r_divisor) bitwise ANDed with 32'h7FFFFFFF.\n\nThe reset signal i_rst, when active, disables the property evaluation.", "reference_sva": "property p_diff_assignment;\n    @(posedge i_clk) disable iff (i_rst)\n        (r_dividend == 32'h00000010 && r_divisor == 32'h00000008) |-> \n        (diff == (r_dividend - r_divisor) & 32'h7FFFFFFF);\nendproperty\nassert_p_diff_assignment: assert property (p_diff_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: diff signal does not reflect the correct difference between r_dividend and r_divisor\");", "generated_sva": "", "relationship": "error", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_diff_assignment\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `diff`, `h00000008`, `h00000010`, `h7FFFFFFF`, `r_dividend`, `r_divisor`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `i_clk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `i_rst` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(r_dividend == 32'h00000010 && r_divisor == 32'h00000008)`\n    * Response condition: `(diff == (r_dividend - r_divisor) & 32'h7FFFFFFF)`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(r_dividend == 32'h00000010 && r_divisor == 32'h00000008)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `(diff == (r_dividend - r_divisor) & 32'h7FFFFFFF)`\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (i_rst)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `i_rst` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge i_clk) (r_dividend == 32'h00000010 && r_divisor == 32'h00000008) |-> (diff == (r_dividend - r_divisor) & 32'h7FFFFFFF)`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_diff_assignment;\n    @(posedge i_clk) disable iff (i_rst)\n        (r_dividend == 32'h00000010 && r_divisor == 32'h00000008) |-> \n        (diff == (r_dividend - r_divisor) & 32'h7FFFFFFF);\nendproperty\nassert_p_diff_assignment: assert property (p_diff_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: diff signal does not reflect the correct difference between r_dividend and r_divisor\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_diff_assignment` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `i_clk`.", "error_message": "Generation error: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable", "generation_time": 7.823002338409424, "verification_time": 2.6226043701171875e-06, "from_cache": false}
