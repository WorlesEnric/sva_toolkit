{"index": 241, "svad": "This property verifies that the fINT signal is correctly assigned based on the logical combination of brk_if[0], gpha, and rFIM1 signals. \n\nThe property triggers at every positive edge of the gclk clock, unless the active-high reset signal grst is asserted. When the trigger condition occurs, the property checks if brk_if[0] is 1, gpha is 1, and rFIM1 is 0 simultaneously. If this condition is true, the property requires that fINT must equal the logical AND of brk_if[0] and gpha and the logical NOT of rFIM1 (which evaluates to 1 in this case).\n\nThe assertion ensures that fINT reflects the correct state derived from brk_if[0], gpha, and rFIM1 signals whenever the specified conditions are met during valid clock cycles.", "reference_sva": "property p_fINT_assignment;\n    @(posedge gclk) disable iff (grst == 1)\n        (brk_if[0] == 1 && gpha == 1 && rFIM1 == 0) |-> (fINT == (brk_if[0] & gpha & ~rFIM1));\nendproperty\nassert_p_fINT_assignment: assert property (p_fINT_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: fINT signal does not reflect the correct state based on brk_if[0], gpha, and rFIM1 conditions\");", "generated_sva": "property fINT_check_prop;\n  @(posedge gclk) disable iff (grst)\n  (brk_if[0] && gpha && !rFIM1) |-> (fINT == 1'b1);\nendproperty\n\nassert_fINT_check: assert property (fINT_check_prop);", "relationship": "equivalent", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_fINT_assignment\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `brk_if`, `fINT`, `gpha`, `rFIM1`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `gclk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `grst` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(brk_if[0] == 1 && gpha == 1 && rFIM1 == 0)`\n    * Response condition: `(fINT == (brk_if[0] & gpha & ~rFIM1))`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(brk_if[0] == 1 && gpha == 1 && rFIM1 == 0)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `(fINT == (brk_if[0] & gpha & ~rFIM1))`\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (grst == 1)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `grst` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge gclk) (brk_if[0] == 1 && gpha == 1 && rFIM1 == 0) |-> (fINT == (brk_if[0] & gpha & ~rFIM1))`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_fINT_assignment;\n    @(posedge gclk) disable iff (grst == 1)\n        (brk_if[0] == 1 && gpha == 1 && rFIM1 == 0) |-> (fINT == (brk_if[0] & gpha & ~rFIM1));\nendproperty\nassert_p_fINT_assignment: assert property (p_fINT_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: fINT signal does not reflect the correct state based on brk_if[0], gpha, and rFIM1 conditions\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_fINT_assignment` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `gclk`.", "error_message": null, "generation_time": 33.11338567733765, "verification_time": 0.02500319480895996, "from_cache": false}
