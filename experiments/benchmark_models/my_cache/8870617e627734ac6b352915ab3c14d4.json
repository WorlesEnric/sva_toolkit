{"index": 911, "svad": "This property verifies that the subtrahend signal is assigned correctly when the circuit is active. The verification triggers on every positive edge of the clk signal, but is disabled when the rst signal is asserted high.\n\nWhen the rst signal is low and the enable signal is high at a clock edge, the property requires that on the very next clock cycle, the subtrahend signal must equal a specific concatenated value. This value consists of three parts: the logical inverse of the small_is_denorm signal from the previous cycle, the mantissa_small value from the previous cycle, and the constant 2-bit value b00.\n\nThe property ensures that one clock cycle after the enable condition is met with no reset, the subtrahend is correctly formed from past values of small_is_denorm and mantissa_small, with the constant b00 appended.", "reference_sva": "property p_subtrahend_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst == 1)\n        (rst == 0 && enable == 1) |-> ##1 subtrahend == {$past(!small_is_denorm), $past(mantissa_small), 2'b00};\nendproperty\nassert_p_subtrahend_assignment_logic: assert property (p_subtrahend_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: subtrahend assignment logic is incorrect.\");", "generated_sva": "property subtrahend_assignment;\n  @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst)\n  (enable) |=> (subtrahend == {!$past(small_is_denorm), $past(mantissa_small), 2'b00});\nendproperty\n\nassert property (subtrahend_assignment);", "relationship": "generated_implies_reference", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_subtrahend_assignment_logic\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `b00`, `enable`, `mantissa_small`, `small_is_denorm`, `subtrahend`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `clk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `rst` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(rst == 0 && enable == 1)`\n    * Response condition: `##1 subtrahend == {$past(!small_is_denorm), $past(mantissa_small), 2'b00}`\n\n* **Edge/Change Detection & Built-in Functions:**\n    * `$past(!small_is_denorm)`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n    * `$past(mantissa_small)`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n\n* **Past Values:**\n    * Reference to previous value of `!small_is_denorm`\n    * Reference to previous value of `mantissa_small`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(rst == 0 && enable == 1)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `##1 subtrahend == {$past(!small_is_denorm), $past(mantissa_small), 2'b00}`\n    * Timing: 1 cycle(s)\n\n* **Temporal Operators Used:**\n    * `##`: Cycle delay operator\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (rst == 1)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `rst` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge clk) (rst == 0 && enable == 1) |-> ##1 subtrahend == {$past(!small_is_denorm), $past(mantissa_small), 2'b00}`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_subtrahend_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst == 1)\n        (rst == 0 && enable == 1) |-> ##1 subtrahend == {$past(!small_is_denorm), $past(mantissa_small), 2'b00};\nendproperty\nassert_p_subtrahend_assignment_logic: assert property (p_subtrahend_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: subtrahend assignment logic is incorrect.\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_subtrahend_assignment_logic` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `clk` using built-in functions: $past.", "error_message": null, "generation_time": 31.82864022254944, "verification_time": 0.02033233642578125, "from_cache": false}
