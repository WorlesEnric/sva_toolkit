{"index": 789, "svad": "This property verifies the assignment logic for signal maxy1 when certain conditions are met. The verification occurs on every positive edge of the clock signal clk, unless the active-high reset signal rst is asserted.\n\nThe property triggers when both DAC equals 1 and signal y is greater than the lower y_bit bits of signal d. When this condition holds, the property requires that signal maxy1 must equal signal y on the same clock cycle.\n\nThe assertion checks that whenever DAC is 1 and y exceeds the specified portion of d, the value of maxy1 is immediately updated to match y's value.", "reference_sva": "property p_maxy1_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst == 1)\n        (DAC == 1 && y > d[y_bit-1:0]) |-> maxy1 == y;\nendproperty\nassert_p_maxy1_assignment_logic: assert property (p_maxy1_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: maxy1 does not equal y when DAC is 1 and y is greater than d[y_bit-1:0]\");", "generated_sva": "", "relationship": "error", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_maxy1_assignment_logic\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `DAC`, `d`, `maxy1`, `y`, `y_bit`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `clk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `rst` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(DAC == 1 && y > d[y_bit-1:0])`\n    * Response condition: `maxy1 == y`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(DAC == 1 && y > d[y_bit-1:0])`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `maxy1 == y`\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (rst == 1)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `rst` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge clk) (DAC == 1 && y > d[y_bit-1:0]) |-> maxy1 == y`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_maxy1_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst == 1)\n        (DAC == 1 && y > d[y_bit-1:0]) |-> maxy1 == y;\nendproperty\nassert_p_maxy1_assignment_logic: assert property (p_maxy1_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: maxy1 does not equal y when DAC is 1 and y is greater than d[y_bit-1:0]\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_maxy1_assignment_logic` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `clk`.", "error_message": "Generation error: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable", "generation_time": 6.632522344589233, "verification_time": 4.76837158203125e-06, "from_cache": false}
