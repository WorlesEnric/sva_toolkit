{"index": 814, "svad": "This property verifies that the InvalidSymbol signal is deasserted (set to 0) exactly one clock cycle after the Reset signal becomes active high. The check is triggered whenever Reset transitions to 1 on the rising edge of the MRxClk clock. The assertion is disabled when Reset is low (0), meaning it only evaluates when Reset is high. The expected behavior is that one clock cycle after Reset is asserted high, InvalidSymbol must be 0.
