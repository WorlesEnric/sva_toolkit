{"index": 568, "svad": "This property verifies that the signal level_0 is set to 0 exactly one clock cycle after the reset signal rst_n is deasserted. The assertion triggers when the reset signal rst_n transitions to 0 (deasserted) on the rising edge of the clock signal clk. Once triggered, the property requires that on the very next clock cycle, the signal level_0 must equal 0.
