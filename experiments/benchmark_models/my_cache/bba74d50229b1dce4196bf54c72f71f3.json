{"index": 442, "svad": "This property verifies that the signal async_rst_b is correctly assigned based on the asynchronous reset signal arst_i and the reset level configuration ARST_LVL. Specifically, whenever the clock signal wb_clk_i rises and the asynchronous reset arst_i is asserted (active high) while ARST_LVL is 0, async_rst_b must equal the exclusive OR of arst_i and ARST_LVL. This means async_rst_b should be 1 under these conditions.
