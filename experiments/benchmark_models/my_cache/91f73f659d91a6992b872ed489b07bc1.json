{"index": 204, "svad": "This property verifies that when the circuit is enabled and not in reset, the signal rMXDST is assigned the previous value of xMXDST on the next clock cycle.\n\nSpecifically, the property triggers at every positive edge of the clock signal gclk, provided the reset signal grst is not asserted. The verification begins when both grst is low (0) and the enable signal gena is high (1). When these conditions are met, the property requires that on the very next clock cycle, the value of rMXDST must equal the value that xMXDST had in the previous cycle.\n\nThe built-in function $past is used to reference the historical value of xMXDST.
