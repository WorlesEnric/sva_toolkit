{"index": 463, "svad": "This property verifies that the module_sel signal correctly reflects the state of the wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i signals during valid Wishbone bus cycles.\n\nThe assertion triggers on every positive edge of the wb_clk_i clock signal, but is disabled when the wb_rst_i reset signal is asserted high.\n\nWhen both wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are asserted high (indicating a valid bus cycle), the property requires that module_sel must also be asserted high.
