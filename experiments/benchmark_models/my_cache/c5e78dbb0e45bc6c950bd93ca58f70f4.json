{"index": 142, "svad": "This property verifies that after the active-high reset signal rst_i is asserted, the state signal is assigned to the value of the wait_state signal from the previous clock cycle.\n\nThe assertion triggers on every positive edge of the clock signal clk_i. The antecedent condition is when the reset signal rst_i equals 1. When this occurs, the consequent requires that on the very next clock cycle, the state signal must equal the past value of the wait_state signal (captured at the previous clock edge).\n\nThe property is disabled and not checked when the reset signal rst_i is low (0).
