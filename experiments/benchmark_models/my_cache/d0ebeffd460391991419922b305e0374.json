{"index": 865, "svad": "This property verifies that the SetPauseTimer signal is correctly assigned when all conditions for a valid pause frame reception are met. \n\nThe assertion triggers on every positive edge of the MRxClk clock, but is disabled when the active-high reset signal RxReset is asserted. The trigger condition occurs when all five signals - ReceiveEnd, ReceivedPauseFrmWAddr, ReceivedPacketGood, ReceivedLengthOK, and RxFlow - are simultaneously high, indicating a valid pause frame has been received.\n\nWhen this condition is true, the property expects SetPauseTimer to be set to the same logical value as the combined condition itself.
