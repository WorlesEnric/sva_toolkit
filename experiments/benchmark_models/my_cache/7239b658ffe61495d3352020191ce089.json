{"index": 228, "svad": "This property verifies that the signal dwb_fb correctly reflects the XNOR (equality) relationship between dwb_stb_o and dwb_ack_i during specific bus handshake conditions.\n\nThe property triggers on every positive edge of the clock signal gclk, but is disabled when the reset signal grst is active high (1).\n\nThe verification occurs specifically when dwb_stb_o is asserted (1) while dwb_ack_i is deasserted (0). Under this condition, the property requires that dwb_fb must equal the XNOR result of dwb_stb_o and dwb_ack_i.
