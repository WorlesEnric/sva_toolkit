{"index": 599, "svad": "This property verifies that the synchro signal becomes zero one clock cycle after the reset signal rst_i is asserted.\n\nThe verification is triggered at every positive edge of the clock signal clk_i when the reset signal rst_i transitions to 1. When this occurs, the property requires that on the very next clock cycle (after one clock cycle delay), the synchro signal must equal 3'b0.\n\nThe assertion is disabled when the reset signal rst_i is 0, meaning no checking occurs while the system is not in reset.
