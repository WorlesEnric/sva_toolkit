{"index": 5, "svad": "This property verifies that the signal core_read_request is correctly assigned when a read request condition occurs. Specifically, whenever i_select is 1 and i_write_enable is 0 on the rising edge of i_clk, the property expects core_read_request to be set to 1, matching the same condition (i_select is 1 and i_write_enable is 0). The assertion triggers immediately when the condition i_select is 1 and i_write_enable is 0 is true at the clock edge, and checks that core_read_request reflects this condition in the same cycle. There are no explicit reset or disable conditions specified in this property.", "reference_sva": "property p_core_read_request_assignment;\n    @(posedge i_clk)\n        (i_select == 1 && i_write_enable == 0) |-> core_read_request == (i_select == 1 && i_write_enable == 0);\nendproperty\nassert_p_core_read_request_assignment: assert property (p_core_read_request_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: core_read_request does not match the expected condition when i_select is 1 and i_write_enable is 0\");", "generated_sva": "", "relationship": "error", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_core_read_request_assignment\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `core_read_request`, `i_select`, `i_write_enable`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `i_clk` (posedge)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(i_select == 1 && i_write_enable == 0)`\n    * Response condition: `core_read_request == (i_select == 1 && i_write_enable == 0)`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(i_select == 1 && i_write_enable == 0)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `core_read_request == (i_select == 1 && i_write_enable == 0)`\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * None specified - property always active\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge i_clk) (i_select == 1 && i_write_enable == 0) |-> core_read_request == (i_select == 1 && i_write_enable == 0)`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_core_read_request_assignment;\n    @(posedge i_clk)\n        (i_select == 1 && i_write_enable == 0) |-> core_read_request == (i_select == 1 && i_write_enable == 0);\nendproperty\nassert_p_core_read_request_assignment: assert property (p_core_read_request_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: core_read_request does not match the expected condition when i_select is 1 and i_write_enable is 0\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_core_read_request_assignment` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `i_clk`.", "error_message": "Generation error: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable", "generation_time": 12.109554529190063, "verification_time": 2.1457672119140625e-06, "from_cache": false}
