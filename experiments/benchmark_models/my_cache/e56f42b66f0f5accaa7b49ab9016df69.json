{"index": 179, "svad": "This property verifies that the write pointer increments correctly during write operations. \n\nThe assertion triggers on every positive edge of the wr_clk clock signal when all of the following conditions are true simultaneously: i_push is asserted (equal to 1), o_full is deasserted (equal to 0), and wr_pointer has not reached its maximum value (is less than all bits set to 1).\n\nWhen these trigger conditions are met, the property requires that on the very next clock cycle (##1), the wr_pointer signal must equal its previous value (captured using $past(wr_pointer)) incremented by exactly 1.\n\nThe built-in function $past is used to reference the value of wr_pointer from the previous clock cycle, establishing the timing relationship that the increment must occur exactly one clock cycle after the trigger conditions are satisfied.\n\nIf this expected behavior does not occur, the assertion will fail and report an error message indicating that the wr_pointer did not increment correctly when i_push was asserted and o_full was deasserted.", "reference_sva": "property p_wr_pointer_increment;\n    @(posedge wr_clk)\n        (i_push == 1 && o_full == 0 && wr_pointer < '1) |-> ##1 wr_pointer == $past(wr_pointer) + 1'd1;\nendproperty\nassert_p_wr_pointer_increment: assert property (p_wr_pointer_increment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: wr_pointer did not increment correctly when i_push is asserted and o_full is deasserted.\");", "generated_sva": "property p_wr_pointer_increment;\n  @(posedge wr_clk)\n  (i_push && !o_full && (wr_pointer < '1)) |=> (wr_pointer == $past(wr_pointer) + 1);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (p_wr_pointer_increment)\n  else $error(\"wr_pointer did not increment correctly when i_push was asserted and o_full was deasserted\");", "relationship": "equivalent", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_wr_pointer_increment\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `d1`, `i_push`, `o_full`, `wr_pointer`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `wr_clk` (posedge)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(i_push == 1 && o_full == 0 && wr_pointer < '1)`\n    * Response condition: `##1 wr_pointer == $past(wr_pointer) + 1'd1`\n\n* **Edge/Change Detection & Built-in Functions:**\n    * `$past(wr_pointer)`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n\n* **Past Values:**\n    * Reference to previous value of `wr_pointer`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(i_push == 1 && o_full == 0 && wr_pointer < '1)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `##1 wr_pointer == $past(wr_pointer) + 1'd1`\n    * Timing: 1 cycle(s)\n\n* **Temporal Operators Used:**\n    * `##`: Cycle delay operator\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * None specified - property always active\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge wr_clk) (i_push == 1 && o_full == 0 && wr_pointer < '1) |-> ##1 wr_pointer == $past(wr_pointer) + 1'd1`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_wr_pointer_increment;\n    @(posedge wr_clk)\n        (i_push == 1 && o_full == 0 && wr_pointer < '1) |-> ##1 wr_pointer == $past(wr_pointer) + 1'd1;\nendproperty\nassert_p_wr_pointer_increment: assert property (p_wr_pointer_increment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: wr_pointer did not increment correctly when i_push is asserted and o_full is deasserted.\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_wr_pointer_increment` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `wr_clk` using built-in functions: $past.", "error_message": null, "generation_time": 21.520824670791626, "verification_time": 0.029946327209472656, "from_cache": false}
