{"index": 762, "svad": "This property verifies that the output signal o_quotient is assigned correctly during division operations when specific conditions are met. The assertion triggers on every positive edge of the clock signal i_clk, but is disabled when the active-high reset signal i_rst is asserted.\n\nThe verification occurs when three conditions are simultaneously true: the busy flag r_busy is 1, the upper half of the divisor r_divisor[(2*BW-2):(BW)] equals zero, and the most significant bit of the difference signal diff[BW] is zero.\n\nWhen these conditions are met, the property requires that on the very next clock cycle (##1), the output o_quotient must equal the concatenation of the previous value of o_quotient's lower bits (specifically bits [(BW-2):0] from the previous cycle, captured using $past) with a single bit 1 appended to the end.\n\nThe property ensures that during active division calculations (r_busy=1) with specific divisor and difference conditions, the quotient output updates correctly by shifting in a 1 bit while preserving its previous lower bits.", "reference_sva": "property p_o_quotient_assignment;\n    @(posedge i_clk) disable iff (i_rst)\n        (r_busy == 1 && r_divisor[(2*BW-2):(BW)] == 0 && diff[BW] == 0) |-> ##1 o_quotient == { $past(o_quotient[(BW-2):0]), 1'b1 };\nendproperty\nassert_p_o_quotient_assignment: assert property (p_o_quotient_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: o_quotient is not assigned correctly when r_busy is 1, r_divisor[(2*BW-2):(BW)] is 0, and diff[BW] is 0\");", "generated_sva": "", "relationship": "error", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_o_quotient_assignment\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `BW`, `b1`, `diff`, `o_quotient`, `r_busy`, `r_divisor`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `i_clk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `i_rst` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(r_busy == 1 && r_divisor[(2*BW-2):(BW)] == 0 && diff[BW] == 0)`\n    * Response condition: `##1 o_quotient == { $past(o_quotient[(BW-2):0]), 1'b1 }`\n\n* **Edge/Change Detection & Built-in Functions:**\n    * `$past(o_quotient[(BW-2)`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n\n* **Past Values:**\n    * Reference to previous value of `o_quotient[(BW-2`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(r_busy == 1 && r_divisor[(2*BW-2):(BW)] == 0 && diff[BW] == 0)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `##1 o_quotient == { $past(o_quotient[(BW-2):0]), 1'b1 }`\n    * Timing: 1 cycle(s)\n\n* **Temporal Operators Used:**\n    * `##`: Cycle delay operator\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (i_rst)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `i_rst` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge i_clk) (r_busy == 1 && r_divisor[(2*BW-2):(BW)] == 0 && diff[BW] == 0) |-> ##1 o_quotient == { $past(o_quotient[(BW-2):0]), 1'b1 }`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_o_quotient_assignment;\n    @(posedge i_clk) disable iff (i_rst)\n        (r_busy == 1 && r_divisor[(2*BW-2):(BW)] == 0 && diff[BW] == 0) |-> ##1 o_quotient == { $past(o_quotient[(BW-2):0]), 1'b1 };\nendproperty\nassert_p_o_quotient_assignment: assert property (p_o_quotient_assignment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: o_quotient is not assigned correctly when r_busy is 1, r_divisor[(2*BW-2):(BW)] is 0, and diff[BW] is 0\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_o_quotient_assignment` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `i_clk` using built-in functions: $past.", "error_message": "Generation error: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable", "generation_time": 7.025890350341797, "verification_time": 4.76837158203125e-06, "from_cache": false}
