{"index": 166, "svad": "This property verifies that the state signal correctly reflects the previous value of the wait_state signal after a reset occurs. Specifically, when the active-high reset signal rst_i becomes asserted (equal to 1), then on the very next clock cycle at the positive edge of clk_i, the state signal must equal the value that wait_state had in the previous clock cycle.
