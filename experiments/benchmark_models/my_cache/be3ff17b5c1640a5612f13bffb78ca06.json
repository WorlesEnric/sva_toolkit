{"index": 779, "svad": "This property verifies that the signal 'd' is assigned a specific pattern one clock cycle after certain conditions occur. The assertion triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal 'clk' and is disabled when the reset signal 'rst' is active-high.\n\nThe trigger condition requires that the reset signal 'rst' is low (0), the signal 'datavalid' is high (1), and the signal 'CLR' is high (1) simultaneously. When these conditions are met, the property expects that on the next clock cycle, the signal 'd' must equal a concatenated pattern consisting of: 'x_bit' number of ones (1'b1), followed by 'x_bit' number of zeros (1'b0), followed by 'y_bit' number of ones (1'b1), and finally 'y_bit' number of zeros (1'b0). The signals 'b0' and 'b1' are not directly referenced in the property's condition or consequent, but they may be related to the values of 'x_bit' and 'y_bit' in the broader context.\n\nIf this expected behavior does not occur, the assertion fails and reports an error.", "reference_sva": "property p_d_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst)\n        (rst == 0 && datavalid == 1 && CLR == 1) |-> ##1 d == { {x_bit{1'b1}}, {x_bit{1'b0}}, {y_bit{1'b1}}, {y_bit{1'b0}} };\nendproperty\nassert_p_d_assignment_logic: assert property (p_d_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: 'd' signal does not match the expected pattern after the specified conditions are met\");", "generated_sva": "", "relationship": "error", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_d_assignment_logic\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `CLR`, `b0`, `b1`, `d`, `datavalid`, `x_bit`, `y_bit`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `clk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `rst` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(rst == 0 && datavalid == 1 && CLR == 1)`\n    * Response condition: `##1 d == { {x_bit{1'b1}}, {x_bit{1'b0}}, {y_bit{1'b1}}, {y_bit{1'b0}} }`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(rst == 0 && datavalid == 1 && CLR == 1)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `##1 d == { {x_bit{1'b1}}, {x_bit{1'b0}}, {y_bit{1'b1}}, {y_bit{1'b0}} }`\n    * Timing: 1 cycle(s)\n\n* **Temporal Operators Used:**\n    * `##`: Cycle delay operator\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (rst)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `rst` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge clk) (rst == 0 && datavalid == 1 && CLR == 1) |-> ##1 d == { {x_bit{1'b1}}, {x_bit{1'b0}}, {y_bit{1'b1}}, {y_bit{1'b0}} }`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_d_assignment_logic;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst)\n        (rst == 0 && datavalid == 1 && CLR == 1) |-> ##1 d == { {x_bit{1'b1}}, {x_bit{1'b0}}, {y_bit{1'b1}}, {y_bit{1'b0}} };\nendproperty\nassert_p_d_assignment_logic: assert property (p_d_assignment_logic) else $error(\"Assertion failed: 'd' signal does not match the expected pattern after the specified conditions are met\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_d_assignment_logic` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `clk`.", "error_message": "Generation error: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable", "generation_time": 8.071388006210327, "verification_time": 5.0067901611328125e-06, "from_cache": false}
