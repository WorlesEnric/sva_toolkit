{"index": 959, "svad": "This property verifies that the prescaler signal increments by one on each clock cycle when specific conditions are met. The assertion triggers on every positive edge of the clk signal, provided the active-high reset signal rst is not asserted.\n\nThe trigger condition requires that rst is low (0), tcnt_write is low (0), and prescaler has not reached its maximum value (indicated by being less than all bits set to 1). When these conditions are true at a clock edge, the property expects that on the very next clock cycle (##1), the prescaler value must equal its previous value (captured using $past) plus one.\n\nThe assertion is disabled when the rst signal is high (1), ensuring it does not check during reset conditions.", "reference_sva": "property p_prescaler_increment;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst == 1)\n        (rst == 0 && tcnt_write == 0 && prescaler < '1) |-> ##1 prescaler == $past(prescaler) + 1;\nendproperty\nassert_p_prescaler_increment: assert property (p_prescaler_increment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: prescaler did not increment correctly when tcnt_write is 0 and prescaler < '1\");", "generated_sva": "property prescaler_increment;\n  @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst)\n  (!rst && !tcnt_write && (prescaler < {$bits(prescaler){1'b1}})) |=> (prescaler == $past(prescaler) + 1);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (prescaler_increment);", "relationship": "equivalent", "cot": "# SVA Generation Chain-of-Thought\n\n**Property:** p_prescaler_increment\n**Type:** Assertion\n\n## Step 1: Interface & Clock Domain Analysis\n\n* **Signals:**\n    * Design Signals: `prescaler`, `tcnt_write`\n\n* **Clocks & Resets:**\n    * Primary Clock: `clk` (posedge)\n    * Reset Signal: `rst` (Active High)\n\n* **Cross-Domain Check:** \n    * Single clock domain - no CDC concerns\n\n## Step 2: Semantic Mapping (Primitives & Built-ins)\n\n* **Boolean Conditions:**\n    * Trigger condition: `(rst == 0 && tcnt_write == 0 && prescaler < '1)`\n    * Response condition: `##1 prescaler == $past(prescaler) + 1`\n\n* **Edge/Change Detection & Built-in Functions:**\n    * `$past(prescaler)`: Reference to signal value from previous cycles\n\n* **Past Values:**\n    * Reference to previous value of `prescaler`\n\n## Step 3: Sequence Construction (Bottom-Up)\n\n* **Sequence A (Trigger/Antecedent):**\n    * Description: The triggering condition that initiates property evaluation\n    * Logic: `(rst == 0 && tcnt_write == 0 && prescaler < '1)`\n\n* **Sequence B (Response/Consequent):**\n    * Description: The expected behavior when trigger occurs\n    * Logic: `##1 prescaler == $past(prescaler) + 1`\n    * Timing: 1 cycle(s)\n\n* **Temporal Operators Used:**\n    * `##`: Cycle delay operator\n\n## Step 4: Property Assembly\n\n* **Implication Type:**\n    * Overlapping (`|->`) - consequent evaluation starts in the same cycle as antecedent match\n\n* **Disable Condition:**\n    * `disable iff (rst == 1)`\n    * Property is disabled when reset `rst` is active high\n\n* **Assertion Structure:**\n    * `@(posedge clk) (rst == 0 && tcnt_write == 0 && prescaler < '1) |-> ##1 prescaler == $past(prescaler) + 1`\n\n## Step 5: Final SVA Code\n\n```systemverilog\nproperty p_prescaler_increment;\n    @(posedge clk) disable iff (rst == 1)\n        (rst == 0 && tcnt_write == 0 && prescaler < '1) |-> ##1 prescaler == $past(prescaler) + 1;\nendproperty\nassert_p_prescaler_increment: assert property (p_prescaler_increment) else $error(\"Assertion failed: prescaler did not increment correctly when tcnt_write is 0 and prescaler < '1\");\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nProperty `p_prescaler_increment` uses overlapping implication synchronized to `clk` using built-in functions: $past.", "error_message": null, "generation_time": 33.671016454696655, "verification_time": 0.032846689224243164, "from_cache": false}
