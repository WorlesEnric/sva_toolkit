{"index": 354, "svad": "This property verifies that the cop_capture signal is set to all ones of width COUNT_SIZE one clock cycle after the asynchronous reset async_rst_b is deasserted.\n\nThe assertion triggers on every positive edge of the bus_clk. When the active-high reset signal async_rst_b transitions to 0 (indicating reset deassertion), the property requires that on the very next clock cycle, cop_capture must equal a value where all COUNT_SIZE bits are set to 1'b1.\n\nThe property is disabled when async_rst_b is 1 (active reset state), meaning the check only becomes active after reset is released.
