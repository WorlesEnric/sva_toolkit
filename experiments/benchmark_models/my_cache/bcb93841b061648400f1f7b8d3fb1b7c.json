{"index": 9, "svad": "This property verifies that whenever the signal wbuf_busy_r is asserted (equal to 1) at the positive edge of the clock i_clk, the signal byte_enable must equal the value of wbuf_sel_r. The assertion triggers when wbuf_busy_r is high, and the expected behavior is that byte_enable matches wbuf_sel_r at that same clock edge.
