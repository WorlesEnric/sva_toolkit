The verification occurs on the rising edge of the clock signal clk_i and is disabled when the reset signal rst_i is active high.\n\nThe trigger condition requires all of the following to be true simultaneously: rst_i is low, the state signal equals wait_state, the draw_line_i signal is high, pixel0_x_i is greater than pixel1_x_i, and pixel1_y_i is greater than pixel0_y_i.\n\nWhen triggered, the property expects that on the next clock cycle, xdiff equals the difference between the previous value of pixel0_x_i and the previous value of pixel1_x_i, while ydiff equals the difference between the previous value of pixel1_y_i and the previous value of pixel0_y_i. The $past function captures the signal values from the previous clock cycle for these calculations.\n\nThe timing relationship specifies that the xdiff and ydiff assignments must occur exactly one clock cycle after the trigger condition is met.",
